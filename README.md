NewsBuzz is a web application that aggregates the latest news from various sources and presents them in an easy-to-read format. With NewsBuzz, users can quickly catch up on the latest news and stay informed about what is happening in the world.
Building this app was a challenging but rewarding experience. I had to learn how to use React, API, and many more which was a new framework for me. It took a lot of effort, but with the help of online resources and my own determination, I was able to make it work.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the React community for their support and guidance. I am thrilled to have completed this project and to have gained valuable skills along the way. I am looking forward to building more apps with React and continuing to learn and grow as a developer.
Thank you for reading this post, and I hope you will check out NewsBuzz and let me know what you think. 😇


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
